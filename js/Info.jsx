    <h2>The PRIME Diet</h2>
    <p>This diet is all about insulin. This hormone is a threshold guardian standing between you and body transformation.</p>
    <p>The foundation of the diet is an insulin reset. This is a strategic approach to your nutrition that will do exactly what the name implies — reset your insulin. Literally. Ultimately, the goal is to increase your insulin sensitivity, which is the first step to making your body better at building muscle and losing fat.</p>
    <h3>MEAL TIMING AND STRUCTURE</h3>
    <h4>Fasting</h4>
    <p>During Prime, you’ll be using what you’ll call the 16/8. Now I’d love to tell you that the 16/8 is a delicious sub sandwich with eight meats and sixteen toppings, but in fact it just means that you will fast for sixteen out of every twenty-four hours, with the remaining eight hours being your feeding window.</p>
    <p>While in some sense it won’t make a huge difference how you structure that breakdown, I recommend setting your feeding window to begin anywhere between noon (ending at eight p.m.) and five p.m. (ending at one a.m.), depending on when you wake up and go to bed. Put another way, you should look to have your first meal about six to eight hours after you wake up, but this isn’t a hard rule.</p>
    <p>Remember, this eating structure is flexible. The number of meals you eat during this time period is up to you, so whether it’s two or five meals doesn’t matter. Your only focus is eating by the clock. Plus, you can shift your eating window. So if one day you want to start eating at noon and the next you want to eat at three p.m., it’s fine—as long as you still end up fasting for sixteen hours and eating for eight.</p>
    <h4>Training and Nutrient Timing</h4>
    <p> You’ll be eating your carbohydrates later in the day in order to maximize the effects of your naturally higher insulin sensitivity. On non-workout days, eat these carbs three to four hours before you go to bed. (If you go to bed at ten p.m., don’t eat carbs before six p.m.) Your meals prior to this will consist of protein and fat.</p>
    <p>On workout days, it’s best to have carbs after your workout; for this reason, we recommend training a bit later in the day. Your first meal of the day should consist of protein and fat and would ideally take place about three to four hours before your workout. Your next meal would be immediately after your workout, and all the allotted carbs for the day should be eaten then.</p>
